42 PTOLEMY V. ELECTED BY ΡΤΑῌ

of Ptah,'' and “ beloved of Ptah‚'’ and it is therefore
evident that the influenoe of the priests of Ptah had
increased considerably since the time of the first three
PtolemieS, and that the power of the priests of Amen,
or Amen-Ra, had diminished in proportion. Thebes,
the home of the cult of Amen and Amen-Ra, had
declined in importanee, and Memphis, the traditional
capital of Mena, the first king of Egypt, had begun to
assume its old proud position, and as a matter of course,
its god Ptah became the head of all the gods of Egypt.
Ptolemy V. was anxious to proclaim himself to be the
“ Son of Ra? and the “living Power of Amen,’' but he
took pains to record the fact that he was “chosen of
Ptah,’' and this title appears in the cartouche contain-
ing his prenomen. This being so, we may confidently
assume that the king was brought into the most holy
place in the temple of Ptah, where the statue of the
god was kept, and that the statue, either by a motion
of its head, or by some movements of its arms
indicated that the god had chosen Ptolemy V. to be
king, probably in the same way as the statues of Amen
at Napata, and Thebes, and the Oasis of Jupiter Ammon
made known their selection and approval of the kings
designate who were brought before them. The Deeree
of Memphis says explioitly that the priests of all the
temples of Egypt were assembled to celebrate the
festival of the coronation of Ptolemy V., but it- will be
observed that no mentionis made either of Thebes or
any other great religious centre of Egypt.
