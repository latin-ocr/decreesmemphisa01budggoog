26 THE ROSETTA STONE

of Cambridge, Part vi., 1815, and also in Archaeoloqia‚
vol. xviii„ 1817. Little of scientific importance on
the Demotic version appeared from this time until 1836,
when FRANQOIS SALVOLINI published his Analyse qram-
maticale raison‘nefe de differens Teoetes Avwiens Eyyptiens‚
Paris, 4to, in the first volume of which he dissected
grammatically the Egyptian texts on the Rosetta Stone.
It was the most scholarly piece of work on the subject
‘which had appeared up to that time, and any reader of
it will see that Salvolini's methodis a good one, and that
he certainly arrived at the true meaning of many words.
For how much of it he deserves the whole credit cannot
be said, and there have been some who asserted that
he derived his information entirely from Champollion’s
papers. It must also be noted too, that many of
Salvolini’s readings were suggested by the translation
of the Demotic version made by Young‚ wh0, as M.
anmourr has so well said,1 “possessed a remarkable
“ faculty of divination, which made him, so to say,
“ smell out the truth‚ although he was unable to
“explain to himself how he did s0.” After an interval
of nine years another valuable work on the Demotic
text appeared, and M. F. DE SAULOY issued his Analyse
Grammaticale du Texte De'motique du De'cret de Rosette,
vol. i.‚ part i.‚ Paris, 1845. This volume may be said
to have placed the study of Demotic upon a scientific
footing among scholam, and it certainly has the merit
of having drawn the late Dr. H. Brugsch to the study
