DEMOTIC DECIPHERMENT 25

appears to run very smoothly, and all the translations
of it suggest a connected, plain narrative. Before, how-
ever, we pass on to consider the contents of the Demotic
version of the Rosetta Stone, it will be well to mention
the works of the chief writers upon it.

The first to study the Demotic text was A. Ι.
81111111οΤ110 DE SA0Y‚1 who in 1802 addressed to
- “ Citoyen Chaptal’' a “Letter,” wherein he attempted
to identify certain Greek proper names3 the next was
J. D. AKERBLAD, who in 0 “Lettre '’ addressed to De
Sacy said that not only had he been able to identify a

in 1802, so that before the end of the year in which
the Rosetta Stone arrived in England, two serious
attempts had been made to decipher the Demotic
version of the Decree by scholars who worked on the
same lineS. Nothing further of importance was done
until the year 1814, when Dr. Thomas Young read
before the Society of Antiquaries of London, on May
19th, 0 “ complete '’ translation of the Demotic version3
this translation was published in the Muscam Oriticum
