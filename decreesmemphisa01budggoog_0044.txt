32 THE ROSETTA STONE

the'se'rpent was to be the symbol of royalty, and not a
mere piece of ornamentation, or one of a number of
serpente, rows of which were attached to shrines to
form symbolic cornices, Further‚ of the ten gold
double crowns which were to be placed on the shrine,
the SEKHENT crown was to have the middle place,
because it was in this crown that 116 appeared at
Memphis when he went into the temple to perform

the coronation ceremonieS. Now the SEKHENT, or

SEKHET, crown ἐξ oy, Ῠὼωῆ U, is composed

of two crowns, namely‚ of ὤ, the crown of the South,

and of H, the crown of the North, or, as these

crowns are commonly called, the “White Crown '²

and the “ Red Crown.'' The White Crown is a symbol
of sovereignty over the White LandS‚ i.e., the deserte,
of the South, and the Red Crown is the emblem of
dominion over the dark-coloured mud lands of the
North, i.e., the Delta. Each crown was in use in
Upper and Lower Egypt in the earliest dynastic times,
and as the union of the two crowns was the visible emblem
of the sovereignty of him that wore them over the
South and the North, and as this union of the crowns
was contemporaneous with the unification of the country
of Egypt by Mena, or Menes, the first king of the
Ist Dynasty, it follows as a. matter of course that each
crown was worn 111 the region of which it represented
the kingship in predynastic times·
