44 TRANSLATIONS OF DEMOTIC TEXT

follows these remarks is based upon the running
German translation by Dr. HeSS‚ and it may be said to
give the general meaning of the version; but in order
that the reader may have before him the prineipal
versions of the Demotie text, and may be able to
compare the variatione which the progress of Demotie de-
oipherment has rendered necessary, it has been thought
well to reproduee the German translation published by
Brugseh in 1850, and the Freneh translation published
byaeMe. E. Revillout in 1880, and the German transla-
tion published by Dr. Hess in 1902.
