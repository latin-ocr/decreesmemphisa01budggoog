THE GREEK TEx‘r 99

Three good Latin translations of the Greek text may
be mentioned, namely, ‘those of AMEILHON, published in
1803, O. G. ΗΕΥΝΕ, published in 1804, and J. BAILEY‚
published in 1816. Of German translations the most
important from a bibliographical point of view is that
of W. DRUMANN, which was published in 1822-1824 ;
of value bibliographically also is FRANOEsco RIOARDI'S
Italian translation, which appeared at Genoa in 1833
under the title Compimento e traduzione della parte
qreca e qeroylessca della Pe‘etra dv: Rosetta col Cataloqo
di tutti i {Jeroqlvjfi'ci spieqati in stallano, It is almost
incredible‚ but this bold, Egyptological pioneer gave
’ a plate in his work in which he restores the missing
portions of the fourteen lines of the hieroglyphic
version which now remain‚ and fails to perceive that
nearly one-half of that version is wanting! As the
translations of the Greek text enumerated above are of
interest and value in connexion with the history of
Egyptian decipherment, and as they are only to be
found in books not readily accessible, it has been
thought well to reprint them at the end of this section
of the present work; the Greek text has also been
translated into Hebrew, but as it has no value for the
general reader it has not been reprinted here.

The information given on the two preceding plates‚
which illustrate the treatment of the Athlophoros and
Canephoros in Greek art, 1 owe to Mr. A. S. Murray,
LL.D., keeper of the Greek and Roman Antiquities in
the British Museum.
