TRANSLATION OF DEMOTIC TEXT 49

“justice to all people, even as doth ΤΗΟΤΗ, the
“twice-great ; and he hath ordered in respect of
“ those of the troops who come back, and the other
“people aISO, who during the strife of the revolu-
“ tion which took place had been ill-disposed
“ (towards the government),

“ that when they return to their homes and lands
“they shall have the power to remain in possession
“ of their property 3 and he hath taken great care
“ to send troops, both cavalry (and) ships against
“those who came to fight against Egypt by sea
“and by land, and hath in consequence expended
“ a very large amount of money and grain, in order
“that the temples and the inhabitants of Egypt
“ might remain in peace3 and, for example, he
“ marched against the town of SHEKAN (Lycopolis),
“ which was in the possession of the

“ enemy, and was provided with catapults and was
“ made ready for war with weapons of every kind3
“ and he surrounded the said town with walls and a
“ rampart against the enemy who were therein‚ for
“ they had caused very great injury to Egypt, and
“they had forsaken the way of the command of the
“ king, and also the ordinances

of the gods ; and he caused the canals which
“ supplied the said town with water to be blocked,
“ which none of the kings who were his pre-
“ decessors were ever able to do, and spent a large
“ amount of money on the carrying out of the work ;
