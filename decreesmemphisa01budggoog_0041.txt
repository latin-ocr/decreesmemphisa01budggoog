SIEGE OF LYCOPOLIS 29

no doubt that, for all practical purposes‚ the Greek and
hieroglyphic texts were considered satisfactory by the
priests, but neither gives th‘e meaning of the carefully
thought-out phrases in all their full details. In proof
of this statement it is sufficient to quote two examples‚
namely‚ the account of the siege and capture of
Lycopoli8‚ and the resolutions which the priests passed
in connexion with the making of the shrine of the king.
The most recent translation of the Greek text is that of
Prof. Mahaffy, 1, who renders the passage thus :—“ and
“having gone to Lycopolis‚ that which is in the
“ Busirite nome, which had been taken and fortified
“ against a siege with a lavish magazine of weapons and
“ all other supplies, seeing that the disloyalty was now
“of long standing among the impious men gathered
“into it, who had done great harm to the temples and
“ all the dwellers in Egypt, and encamping against
“ them, he surrounded it with mounds and trenches and
“ remarkable fort-ifications3 but when the Nile made a
“ great rise in the eighth year (of his reign), and was
‘⁴ wont to inundate the plains‚ he prevented it, having
“ dammed from many points the outlets of the streams‚
“spending upon this no small amount of money ; and
“having set cavalry and infantry to guard them, he
“presently took the town by storm and destroyed all
“ the impious men in it‚” etc. It is true that this
rendering represents the meaning of the Greek version
well enough, but the difficulty is to understand exactly
