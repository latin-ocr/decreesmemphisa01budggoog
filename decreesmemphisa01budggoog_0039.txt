of the Egyptian language. In 1847 Ε. de Rouge con-
tributed to the Revue Archc'oloyv'que (pp. 321-343) an
important “ Lettre a Μ. (16 Saulcy, sur les elementa
de l’ecriture demotique des Egyptians,” and in 1848 Dr.
Brugsch began to publish the series of works on ,
Demotic which has made his name famous, and his
quarto pamphlet‚ entitled “ Scriptura Aegyptiorum
demotica ex papyris et inscriptionibus explanata‚”
appeared at Berlin. In the first part of his Sammlunq
Demotisoher Urkunden‚ Berlin, 1850, he gave a transla-
tion of the Demotic text of the Rosetta stone, with a
running commentary‚ and he added renderings of the
interlinear hieroglyphic and Demotic text of 1116 1)661·66

Emmanuel de Rouge au sujet de la decouverte d’un
manuscrit bilingue sur papyrus en ecriture (1611101160-
egyptienne et en Grec cursis de l’an 114 avant notre ere‚”
Berlin, 1850 ; and five years later he gave to the world
his “Grammaire Demotique,'’ wherein he explained
the general principles of the language and “ ecriture
populaire'’ of the ancient Egyptians. As the other
Demotic publications of Dr. Brugsch‚ and the works of
MM. Maspero and Pierret on the subject do not

appearance of the first part of an attempt to analyze the
Demotic text of the Rosetta Stone made by the late Dr.
Eisenlohr in 1869, and finally that of the “Critical
