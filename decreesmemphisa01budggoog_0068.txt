THE ROSETTA STONE

Egypt, in addition to the titles which they already
hold, shall have the title, “ Priests of the Grod who
“maketh himself manifest, whose deeds are
“beautiful,” and this title shall be endorsed on
all deeds and documents which are laid up
[in the temples], and the title of every priest
of the God who maketh himself manifest, whose
deeds are beautiful, shall be engraved upon his
r1ng3

and the people of the country, and the soldiers
who wish to make to appear the aforesaid golden
shrine of the Grod who maketh himself manifest,
whose deeds are beautiful, shall be permitted (‘?)
to have it with them in their habitations, and they
shall celebrate each year the festivals which are
described above, and they shall make the [pre-
scribed] processions3 and in order that it may be
made known why the Egyptians pay honour—as
is most right and proper to do-to the Grod who
maketh himself manifest, whose deeds are beau-
tiful, ¹
[the priests have decreed] that this DEOREE shall
be inscribed upon a stele of hard stone in the
writing of the divine words, and in the writing of
the books, and in the writing of the GreekS, and
that [a similar stele] shall be set up in the temples
of the first, and second, and third order, side by
side with the statue of the God Ptolemy, the ever-

living.
